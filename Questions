In the salamander-PGLS markdown, in line 35 when it makes a list of taxa to drop from the tree to 
not be used in the analyses (those that I don't have an external eye diameter measurement for, 
like some of the aquatic ones) the list just includes every species. So, when I go to run the 
models, there is no data to run it with because R has dropped these 'unwanted' tips from the 
phylogeny. I think what might be happening is in the tree, the names are written like 
'Dicamptodon copei', and in my datasets I have it written like 'Dicamptodon_copei', so R 
recognizes that none of them match. If this is the reason why it's not working, should I change 
one of them to be consistent? Or if you see another problem, let me know.

Additionally, is there a way to stretch the phylogenetic tree vertically in R? It is so smushed 
together that I cannot read the species names. Is this just an issue with how the file was
saved on my computer?

I also uploaded the most updated versions of the csv files I used in the Data folder.
