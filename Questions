In Rmd file 3-allometry...

In line 164 when checking if the names in the dataframe match those in the tree, there is like 9 species that don't match. I'm unsure why this 
is happening because when I look at the dataframe, the species are there.
In lines 297, 337, 376, and 415, the best fit lines are pretty off. I tried a couple different changes but none seem to be working. I'm not sure 
if the problem is because of the species that aren't matching from the problem above.

In Rmd file 4-eye_investment...

In line 173 and below, I encounter the same problem with names not matching as in the previous rmd.

In Rmd file 7-PGLS.analysis...

How to specify factor level reference with a PGLS analysis. I was trying it for the larval habitat vs. eye size boxplot, but then I gave up.

Thank you!
