In the salamander-PGLS markdown, in line 35 when it makes a list of taxa to drop from the tree to 
not be used in the analyses (those that I don't have an external eye diameter measurement for, 
like some of the aquatic ones) the list just includes every species. So, when I go to run the 
models, there is no data to run it with because R has dropped these 'unwanted' tips from the 
phylogeny. I think what might be happening is in the tree, the names are written like 
'Dicamptodon copei', and in my datasets I have it written like 'Dicamptodon_copei', so R 
recognizes that none of them match. If this is the reason why it's not working, should I change 
one of them to be consistent? Or if you see another problem, let me know.

> Your problem here is that you haven't yet put your data into a dataframe or inputted it, so av.edmass doesn't have any data in it, which is why it's saying none of your data matches the phylogeny. 

Additionally, is there a way to stretch the phylogenetic tree vertically in R? It is so smushed 
together that I cannot read the species names. Is this just an issue with how the file was
saved on my computer?

>yes, you can control the dimensions in the header of the r chunk. example:

```{r, fig.height=12, fig.width=5}

```

You can also adjust the size of the text on the tip labels using cex. example:

plot.phylo(caudatatree, show.tip.label=TRUE, cex = 0.5)


I also uploaded the most updated versions of the csv files I used in the Data folder.
